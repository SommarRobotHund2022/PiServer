Important, the sockets subsribe and publishes one to many, many to one. 
Therefore indentifier are needed when sending things over the sockets. Like if you want to talk to dog 1 u need D1:, dog 2: D2: in the string being sent
The same goes for the other direction, make sure the "dogs" sends an identifier when trying to send information with Dog 1: D1:, Dog 2: D2:
